# Starsector-WS_Portraits
A very simple mod for Starsector that adds more portraits to the game.

To install this mod, copy the "wsMod" folder and its contents into your Starsector "mods" directory. Choose the mod from the splash screen.

An easy way to obtain the folder with minimal fuss is to click the green "clone or download" button. Save the resulting zip file, and then extract the "wsMod" folder from there.

Change notes 8/10/2019:
Currently contains two portraits that are excluded from NPC picks (so available only to the player).
