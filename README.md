# Starsector-WS_Portraits
A very simple mod for Starsector that adds more portraits to the game.

To install this mod, copy the "wsMod" folder and its contents into your Starsector "mods" directory. Choose the mod from the splash screen.

Change notes 8/10/2019:
Currently contains two portraits that are excluded from NPC picks (so available only to the player).
